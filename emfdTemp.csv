"Levi says: â€œThere is so much inequality in the world. The fact that some countries are swimming in money while other countries have nothing is really incomprehensible. It is no more than normal that we as the Netherlands give money to development aid. It should actually be much more in my opinion. In the past, money to developing countries has already led to many vaccinations against deadly diseases such as diphtheria and tetanus in developing countries and access to clean drinking water for many people. I think the argument that the underlying cause is not being addressed is too easy. For example, there is also a lot of development cooperation in terms of training local staff in health care and education. This is simply a structural improvement in a country. This is also partly due to development aid, of course. I also once read that HIV-positive people in developing countries are given AIDS inhibitors and how many lives this improves. These are just a few examples. Of course, it must be handled carefully so that the money ends up where it belongs and does not remain in the Netherlands. And so that the corrupt leaders of a country do not run off with it. I like to believe that that happened a lot in the past, but it is handled much more carefully these days. And even apart from that, doing nothing or trying to do nothing is unacceptable anyway. We should all be able to succeed in distributing everything a bit fairly, wouldn't you say?"
