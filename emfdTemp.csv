To see that such a virus actually destroys so many lives and that it has been going on for so long, I really never thought that. I am now also at a point where I find it difficult to imagine everyday life before the corona crisis. When I see large groups of people on television now, I think: ''oh, you have to keep a meter and a half apart'' or ''hey, that's a lot of people together''. I have the idea that it will never be completely normal again to stand with a large group of people. That is why I think the corona crisis has made the biggest impression on me. I think it's bad that many people say that homosexuality is much more accepted, because I still hear stories very often that that is not the case at all. I think homosexuality is something normal and I don't think it's strange to see men kissing each other, for example.
I also think it's very bad for some people who can't be open and honest about their orientation at home, because their family doesn't agree with it. 
I think it's good that social media and television contribute to the acceptance of homosexuality, for example through programs like 'Prince Charming', in which people can also see ''hey, these are boys who are in love, and that's nothing more than normal.'' I think people can take it too personally. I have also seen many theories that Black Pete was not a slave at all. I think it is a shame that a tradition is changed like this nowadays. 
On the other hand, I think it is a good solution to use colored Petes, because you cannot hurt people this way. Children do not really notice it and I have the idea that they do not mind a change very much. 
Still, I think it is a shame that (for me at least) it is a childish tradition that has to be ""ruined"" by adults. I think it's a shame that there is such a big climate problem. I try to do my part to improve it, but I know that I could do a lot more to improve it even more. 
I did think about it more because of a documentary on Netflix. Before watching this documentary, I knew almost nothing about the climate problem. Now that I know more about it, and especially how serious it is, I try to do my part to improve it. 
Furthermore, I don't really have a particularly extensive opinion about it, because I think I can read up on the subject even more than I do now."
