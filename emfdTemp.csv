My whole life has actually been turned upside down and turned upside down by the corona virus. As a student who was just 18 when corona started and could only just enjoy life, it was of course a huge intervention in my daily life. From one moment to the next, I was no longer allowed to go to school, I got a diploma without exams, and I started a study in my living room. Since I was just 18, I was no longer allowed to do sports, which I found quite drastic because I did that a lot. I was also not allowed to go to university, while my brother and sister were allowed to go to school and do sports for a long time. 
I had to miss my friends and family, which had a big impact on me; I found it difficult to deal with this well. I felt kind of locked up for a long time; where do you go when you have all the time in the world, but nothing is allowed or possible? It took me a while to get used to the new situation. I don't have a very strong opinion about Black Pete. I understand where the discussion comes from and I can certainly understand both sides of the conflict. On the one hand, I understand that people find it difficult to let go of a centuries-old tradition; it is a piece of Dutch heritage that you are putting on the street. On the other hand, I also understand that in today's society with the Black Lives Matter protests you cannot do something like it used to be. Back then you were simply in a different situation, where racism was not yet such a current issue. Now it is actually coming to light that the way it was then is actually not appropriate. But to change such an important aspect of children's lives now is no easy task.

I also believe that traditions should be continued, but that they can still be adapted to the current environment and context. So I am in favor of soot-faced Petes; the children hardly notice any difference and the tradition can continue, but the intense stereotype is broken. On the other hand, I find multiple colours a bit strange, as it mainly causes confusion. I believe that it is good for many small states or countries to work together and make agreements together, in order to prevent danger and make it as easy as possible. I think unity is very appropriate, supporting each other in good times and bad. Together you can get much further than alone. In order to compete with major powers such as China or the United States, you have to work together as small countries. You can't do much alone.
I think the EU is working well together to tackle corona, to ensure safety. The borders that have been agreed upon together are well regulated, which means that you can actually work anywhere in the EU. Of course we pay for this, but I think it is worth it.
I am also in favor of financial support, in my opinion it is good to ensure cooperation in which countries in crisis are supported. Even if the inhabitants feel the consequences of this; if it had been the other way around, they would have been happy about that too.

All in all, I am positive about the European Union, because history also shows that cooperation is better than working individually. I am in favor of the fact that care should be provided to everyone, not just to people who can afford it, as is the case in America. I like that expensive operations are paid for, and that people who cannot afford them do not have to suffer. If something is wrong with you, you can always go to a general practitioner or hospital, without too high costs.

What I am a bit against are the costs of the deductible. I would personally adjust them to the human capital that someone has. For a student, a minimum deductible of 385 euros is quite a lot of money to spend on treatment. Someone who earns 50,000 + per year can much more easily miss an amount like that. That is why I would prefer to see the deductible increase as income increases. 

But don't get me wrong, I am very happy with the good insurance that we have in the Netherlands, and the support that young people up to 21 (?) receive through the healthcare allowance. Healthcare should be available to everyone, at all times, and fortunately it currently is."
