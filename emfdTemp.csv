At one point there was an old man using a machine near my machine. We made eye contact more often and I kept smiling at him. At one point he came up to me and we started talking. He told me his whole life story and I think we talked for about an hour because he kept going, but it was a genuinely nice conversation. At the end of my conversation he told me that he thought it was really sweet that I smiled at him more often and that he doesn't do that often and that he finds it difficult to get in touch with other people and that he is quite lonely and so the fact that I smiled at him meant a lot to him and that he also really liked the fact that I started talking to him. It made an impression on me, because what was a very small gesture for me, was a very big gesture for him. And the fact that I chatted with him for a while had made his whole day. This just goes to show that a small gesture for you can be a big gesture for someone else and make their day. I think Black Pete is racist. The story about Black Pete originated from slavery and racism. A white man who uses dark people as helpers is no longer possible in this day and age. In addition, Black Pete is simply blackface. People say that it is because they go through the ""chimney"", but that does not make sense. Why are the Petes completely painted black and do they have thick red lips and an afro? In addition, they say it is tradition and it is important, but it is and remains a children's party and children do not care what the Petes look like, even if they are all the colours of the rainbow, the children just want candy and presents. It is the adults who make such a big deal out of it that the tradition is ruined. It is very simple, many dark people are called Black Petes and feel discriminated against, including children. It is a children's party and it should be fun for every child in the Netherlands without them being discriminated against. Nowadays there is still a lot of racism in the Netherlands and I think that keeping Black Pete contributes to that. Black Pete is just a children's party that should be fun for every child and I think that adults should not cling to the color of Pete. It really doesn't make sense. I think there is a lot of misconception about terrorism. Terrorism is a complicated subject that causes fear in many people. People often think that terrorism is only done by a certain group, namely Muslims. This is certainly not the case, but because of the attacks by ISIS and the media, many people think that only Muslims can be terrorists and commit terrorist attacks. In reality, there are all kinds of different groups that commit terrorist acts, regardless of their religion. To my knowledge, terrorism is about the use of violence or the threat of violence for political, religious or ideological goals and can occur in many different contexts and forms. Terrorism is not just a person with a backpack with a bomb in it who blows himself up and takes a number of people with him. It is done in so many different forms and by different groups of people. It is a shame that terrorism is mainly associated with Islam and Muslims. As I indicated earlier, the media also plays a very large role in this. How often do you hear ""Christian man from the Netherlands committed a terrorist attack and there are a lot of deaths""? The word terrorism is almost never used when it comes to a white person from the West, but it is used when it comes to a Muslim. So I think there are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to terrorism, but of course it remains horrible and scary. The Dutch healthcare system is quite good, but there are certainly things that could be improved. One of the things that I like is that health insurance is mandatory for everyone, which is of course important so that everyone can receive care. For example, look at America, where that is not the case, which means that many people end up in deep debt. But healthcare is becoming more expensive every year, which means that many people find it difficult to pay for it. Insurance is becoming more expensive every year and the deductible is also quite high. In my opinion, healthcare should be affordable and accessible for everyone, but with the direction we are heading in now, that will unfortunately become less and less possible. I also think that there is very little attention for mental well-being in healthcare. The waiting lists are very long, so people sometimes have to wait months or years before they are helped with certain mental illnesses, such as an eating disorder. More attention should also be paid to this and there should be more facilities in healthcare. Mental health is also something that many people struggle with. 
In general, the Dutch healthcare system is quite okay, but there are certainly things that could be improved."
